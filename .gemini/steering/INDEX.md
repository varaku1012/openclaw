# OpenClaw AI Steering Context

Welcome, AI Architect/Developer. This directory contains the authoritative steering context for the OpenClaw repository. Use these documents to ensure your contributions align with the project's architecture, security standards, and long-term goals.

## Directory Index

1.  **[GUARDRAILS.md](./GUARDRAILS.md):** **START HERE.** The non-negotiable rules, coding standards, and "done criteria".
2.  **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md):** High-level system overview, domain models, and data flow.
3.  **[VERTICALIZATION.md](./VERTICALIZATION.md):** Guide for building industry-specific solutions (Restaurants, etc.).
4.  **[PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md):** WebSocket RPC and event reference.
5.  **[RESILIENCE.md](./RESILIENCE.md):** Patterns for error handling, security, and reliability.

## How to use this context
- **Before coding:** Review `GUARDRAILS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **When adding a feature:** Check `RESILIENCE.md` for safety patterns.
- **When building a vertical:** Follow the `VERTICALIZATION.md` blueprint.
- **When debugging protocol:** Reference `PROTOCOL.md`.
